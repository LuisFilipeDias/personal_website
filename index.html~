								Weights App was created to fulfil a very simple purpose: to end the neglect of the weights at the Gym.<br>   
								The idea was to make it a great and versatile tool for both the weight machines but also the cardio exercises.<br>  
								To do this, the application had to include the following features:<br><br>
								<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 Logging of different gym exercises;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Support for both the weight & the cardio machines;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Keeping track of the exercises evolution;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Registration of the performance evolution;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Flexibility to change/edit the logs;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Integration of the Google Material Design (similarly to Horarios Vimeca);</li>
								</ul></ul>												

								Besides these features, the application had to be simple, easy-to-use and provide the core functions within very clicks, in order to make it useable for gym environments.<br><br>

								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/weights.jpg" data-lightbox="image-a">

									</a>							
								</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
								</ul>
								As pictured above, Weighs App contained different menus for the different features, all accessible from a unique sidebar:<br><br>
								<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>The List</b>:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>&#9632 Main door(menu) of the App;</li>
												<li>&#9632 List to record all the activities (entries);</li>
												<li>&#9632 Allows entering a machine or a cardio exercise;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Contains the Name, Machine ID and Latest Log of the entry;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Allows list sorting for each of the fields;</li>												
												<li>&#9632 Allows edition of every entry;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Supports a brief description for each entry;</li>
											</ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>myEvolution</b>:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>&#9632 Contains a graph with the stats for every entry;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Plots a Weight/Repetitions/Series graph for the machines;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Plots a Distance/Duration/Level graph for the cardio;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Allows list sorting for Name and ID;</li>
											</ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>myWeight</b>:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>&#9632 Logs the weight values;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Plots the weight evolution;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Records the log entries details;</li>
											</ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Examples</b>:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>&#9632 Not yet implemented;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Will contain a set of predefined exercises;</li>
											</ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Remove</b>:</li><ul>
												<li>&#9632 Simple interface to remove deprecated exercises;</li>
												<li>&#9632 Support removal of one or many entries at a time;</li>
											</ul>
									</ul></ul>
								
								Besides the features above, there is also a settings menu to allow the user to change between imperial (Pounds & Miles) and metric (Kilometers & Kilograms) units.<br>

								</p>
								Ever since Horarios Vimeca first version was released, it had been downloaded over 1700 times, having more than 600 active installations.<br>
								The App had good reviews, for it was fulfilling it's purpose without major flourishes.<br>
								Nevertheless the number of active users of the application had stop increased for a while, and there where some problems and complaints.<br>
								Amongst them:<br><br>								
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 A few timetables stopped working;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Some routes couldn't be loaded;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Advertising banner was unwelcome;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Some summer/winter timetables where switched;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Application would sometimes block;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Data loading was very was slow;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Users couldn't access the data offline;</li>
										<li>&#9658 There was no option to save a favourites list;</li>
									</ul></ul>			
								
								Furthermore, with the release of Android version 5.0 and the Material Design, the appearance became rather old fashioned.<br>
								Regarding this, the Google Material Design guidelines <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">(click here for more info)</a>, were very handy, since they brought a standardized form for a simple, nice and clean interface.<br><br>

								<ul>
									<li><strong>The Restyling</strong></li>
								</ul>

								The new Horarios Vimeca application, pictured above, touched three different points:<br><br>
								
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 Correction of bugs, reported on the previous version;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Introduction of a new look & feel, compatible with the latest Google guidelines;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Introduction of new features, to enhance the App potential;</li>
									</ul></ul>			
								
								Starting with the design, the purpose was to achieve:<br><br>
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 Cleaner/simpler interface, respecting the new graphical guidelines;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Backwards compatibility to older Android versions;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Brand new logo, in line with the Material Design;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Faster loading of information;</li>
										<li>&#9658 One menu to access all the features;</li>
									</ul></ul>			
								
								Interlinked with the new design, the added main features where the following:<br><br>
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 Favourites menu, for both routes and timetables;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Institutional information menu, with Vimeca information/contacts;</li>  	
										<li>&#9658 Access to saved data offline;</li>
									</ul></ul>			

								<b>UPDATE:</b> about six months after the release of this new version, the results were clear: about 30% more active users (above 850).<br>
								Also, the number of total installs jumped from about 1700 to more than 2200, and the cumulative average rating also increased.<br><br>

								<h2>Meteo Station [2013]</h2>
							</header>
							<div id="text_format">
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The Basics</strong></li>
								</ul>
									The idea: to build a homemade Meteorological Station.<br>
									Why: to practice the Python scripting.<br>
									How: using the versatile Raspberry Pi (which was already introduced <a href="#RPi">here</a>).<br>
									To go along with the Raspberry, I chose: a temperature sensor, a couple of PIC16F819, two matched RF Transceivers and a breadboard.
									With these components I started the project: to create a Meteorological Station (or, a "basic digital thermometer").<br>
									Below I explain the project in further detail, in 3 parts: the <b>Reading Station</b>; the <b>Link to the Internet</b>; and the <b>Displaying Website</b>.
								<br><br>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Reading Station</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/pic16f.jpg" data-lightbox="image-a">
										<img src="images/pic16f.jpg" height="400" style="float:right; margin: 0 5% 1% 5%; border-radius:10px;"/>
									</a>
								</p>
									This 1st part of the system, where the temperature is sensed, is a standalone module powered by a battery and so, completely portable (up to a certain radius distance from the Raspberry Pi).<br>
									The main components are:<br><br>
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b> 
											<a href="http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/data_sheets/TMP35_36_37.pdf" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">TMP37:</a></b> 
											a simple low voltage temperature sensor from <a href="http://www.analog.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">Analog</a>. 
											This sensor is intended for applications over the range of 5 C to 100 C and provides an output scale factor of 20 mV/C.
										</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>
											<a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39598F.pdf" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">PIC16F189:</a></b> 
											a generic purpose Microcontroller from <a href="http://www.microchip.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">Microchip</a>, with the essential features (for this project) of Analog-to-Digital conversion and UART interfacing; 
										</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>
											<a href="http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1053" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">Wireless RF Transceiver:</a></b> 
											a 2 pieces RF Transceiver with an UART interface, for establishing the communication between the serial interfaces of the PIC16F819 and the Raspberry Pi.</b>
										</li>					
									</ul></ul>
									The configuration setup is very simple: a simple C program is loaded into the PIC, to read the TMP37 output voltage with the internal ADC.
									This program is then responsible to send the raw information (hexadecimal format from 0x00 to 0xFF) through the serial interface into the PIC RF module which forwards it to its twin module, on the Raspberry side.<br><br>
								
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Link to the Internet</strong></li>
								</ul>
									The information emitted above is then received by the Raspberry Pi, using its RF Module connected to the serial interface.
									A Python script transforms the hexadecimal information gathered into both Voltage and Temperature using the formulas:<br><br>
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Voltage</b> = Raw/255 * 5 V;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Temperature</b> = Voltage * 50 C;</li>
									</ul></ul>
																		
									The reason to process the information at this side of the link instead of the PIC's side, is to simplify the information transmission (only the raw signal is sent). 
									Furthermore the purpose of the whole project was to improve the Python scripting skills, and not the C programming.<br>
									Having the information on the Raspberry side, the python script is then responsible to upload it to an SQL server online.
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/rasp_rf.jpg" data-lightbox="image-a">
										<img src="images/rasp_rf.jpg" width="400" style="margin: 4% 5% 1% 5%; border-radius:10px;"/>
									</a>
								
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Displaying Website</strong></li>
								</ul>
									Here a php script running on a webserver, accesses the same SQL database that is linked to the Raspberry, and downloads the latest temperature.
									This value is then printed on the display inside a circle which has different colours for distinct temperatures:
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b style="color: blue;">Blue:</b> temperature is less than 10 C;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b style="color: green;">Green:</b> temperature is in between 10 C and 20 C;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b style="color: orange;">Orange:</b> temperature is in between 20 C and 30 C;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b style="color: red;">Red:</b> temperature is higher than 30 C;</li>
									</ul></ul>			
									The aforementioned website, which is public and available at <a href="http://meteo.comuv.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">http://meteo.comuv.com/</a> is quite straightforward and effective in filling its only purpose (for now at least): showing the current temperature of the room where the Reading Station is located at.
									A picture is found below.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/meteo_web.png" data-lightbox="image-a">
										<img src="images/meteo_web.png" width="500" style="float:center; margin: 0 5% 1% 5%; border-radius:10px;"/>
									</a>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>To be Continued</strong></li>
								</ul>
									The first part of the project was finished with success, but further improvements are lacking:
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Specific voltage reference:</b> for improving the measurements accuracy;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Some batteries:</b> replacing the USB power connection will improve the system versatility;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>More/Different sensors:</b> carbon monoxide gas sensor, gas sensor, relative humidity sensor, e.g.;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>New PCB:</b> instead of a breadboard, the final system should be embedded on a PCB;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Custom Case:</b> for a final product look, a case ought be made to protect the whole system.</li>
									</ul></ul>	
									UPDATE: the site is still online, but the Meteo Station is currently not working.

									As a customer of the <a title="Vimeca Website" class="link" href="http://www.vimeca.pt" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vimeca</a>'s Bus company for over half a year, I noticed a deficit of information on the Bus timings.
									No digital information panel, not even the printed timetables posted on the Bus stop. 
									This meant inability to know the arrival times of the different Buses.<br>
									Similarly to Cantina Siemens app, the information is also gathered online, in this case from <a title="Vimeca Website" class="link" href="http://www.vimeca.pt" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vimeca</a>'s website (<a title="Vimeca Website" class="link" href="www.vimeca.pt">www.vimeca.pt</a>) where all the timetables and routes are available.
																		
								<ul>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Showcase</strong></li>
								</ul>
									
									
								<p>
									Guiding up on the screenshots below we have that: the first view displayed is the loading menu, where the selected bus timetable is loaded in the background.						
									Then the main view is displayed, and organized as follows:
								</p>
									<ul><ul>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Selected Bus ('Autocarro')</b>: list to select which Bus schedules are to be displayed;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Origin of the departure ('Origem')</b>: the direction from which to display the schedules;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Departure hour ('Hora de partida')</b>: a filter applied to the timetable, to simplify the search of the desired hour;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Route ('Percurso')</b>: loads the route image on a new view, for display on the device;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Circulation days ('Sem', 'Sab', Dom')</b>: days of circulation and respective schedules divided in: Weekdays ('Sem'), Saturday ('Sab') and Sunday ('Dom');</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Selected Departure</b>: selected origin of departure;</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Bus Origin departures</b>: main feature, list with the departing hour from the origin of the course. To get the hours for the intermediate stops, the Route option must be used.</li>
										<li>&#9658 <b>Additional Information ('Clique para obter...)'</b>: pop-up with any additional information available at the website.</li><br>

									<a href="images/vimeca.png" data-lightbox="image-0">
										<img src="images/vimeca.png" width="600"/>
									</a>
								</p>
									Although internet access is required on the first use of this application, so as to load the required Bus information, this information is then stored in a SQLite database on the device.<br>
									This means that the information on the timetable becomes available even for offline access.<br>
									Offline access was viewed as an indispensable feature since the beginning of the development, given that internet access at the Bus stops is scarce, and lacking it would frustrate the purpose.<br>

								<h2>Cantina Siemens [2013]</h2>
							</header>
							<div id="text_format">
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The Beginning</strong></li>
								</ul>
								Cantina Siemens was the first Android experience, and came from the need to learn by creating something new and useful.<br>
								Basically:<br><br>
								<ul><ul>
									<li>&#9658 Cantina Siemens was the canteen of my workplace, at Amadora-Lisbon, that serves daily meals both to the employees of <a class="link" href="http://www.siemens.com/entry/pt/pt/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Siemens</a>, <a href="http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="link">Nokia Siemens Networks</a>, and <a class="link" href="http://www.coriant.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coriant</a>.</li>
									<li>&#9658 The canteen has different daily menus, whose contents are weekly updated on a proper website, thus allowing people to access the menus for the week.</li>
									<li>&#9658 The idea was to bring this access to the mobile world.</li>
									<li>&#9658 <strong>The idea was to simplify!</strong></li>
								</ul></ul>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>The Application</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>The application very simple, consisting on only 3 different views.</p>
								<ul>
								<ul>
									<li>&#9658 The Loading Screen</li>
									<li>&#9658 The Menu;</li>
									<li>&#9658 The Plate Listing (on both Portuguese and English).</li>
								</ul>
								</ul>
								<p>These views are found on the picture below:</p>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/cantina.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
										<img src="images/cantina.png" width="600"/>
									</a>
								</p>
								
								The application's operation is as follows:<br><br>
								<ul>
								<ul>
									<li>&#9658 The App is launched, if there is a network connection available the plates data is loaded into a String array, during which the loading screen is shown, if there is no internet access, the user is prompted to check the network connections;</li>
									<li>&#9658 Then, the menu is loaded, where the user can launch the plate listing window in Portuguese or in English, refresh the list or get some info on the application;</li>
									<li>&#9658 The last view contains the plates and is divided in smaller windows, each for the a day of the week.</li>
								</ul>
								</ul>
								<p>
									This application is publicly available for Android, where it can be found and downloaded from Google Play.
								If you want to try it out, just download it by clicking on the image below.

									<a href="images/rpi_1.jpg" data-lightbox="image-2">
										<img src="images/rpi_1.jpg" height="250"  style="float:right; margin: 0 5% 1% 5%; border-radius:10px;"/>
									</a>
								</p>
								<ul>	
									<li><strong>Raspwho?</strong></li>
								</ul>


								The Raspberry Pi is a small computer developed for teaching purposes but whose potential has facilitated its deployment as a very powerful tool for both homemade projects and even some companies.
								The possibility to have a computer for $40, running a Linux OS, connected to the internet, and having directly available for example an UART, an I2C module or a dozen of GPIO pins, is very attractive.<br><br>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>SSH Remote Control</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>One of the first thing I made was registering a dynamic DNS service, so I could gain remote access to the Raspberry (connected to the web via the Ethernet port). Having done this I also enabled on my router the NAT service, where I mapped the SSH Port of my $40 computer to a public Port. This way I became capable to enter the device&#8217;s terminal from any place of the web, and thus configure it. Even though an LCD could be connected via HDMI port, as well as a keyboard and a mouse turning this low-cost PC into a &#8220;normal&#8221; computer, I&#8217;ve chosen to access it from my PC with SSH, allowing a more comfortable operation.</p>
								<ul>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/rpi_2.jpg" data-lightbox="image-2">
										<img src="images/rpi_2.jpg" height="200" style="float:left; margin: 0 5% 1% 5%; border-radius:10px;"/>
									</a>
								</p>
								<li><strong>FTP Server</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>As a second step, I configured an FTP server running as a daemon, and then plugged an  USB Flash Drive on the Raspberry Pi, so I could share files between all the computers on my network, and store them on only one location. Furthermore I mapped both FTP Ports on the router with NAT, and so I gained access to these files from any remote place. In a near future I&#8217;m considering replacing the USB Flash Drive with an 1 TB HD Drive using a Hub (since it draws a lot of current), thus creating a spot on the network where I can access all my data.</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Transmission Remote<br /></strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Another configuration I made, towards a more integrated/practical IT environment, was configuring a Torrent client (namely Transmission), running as daemon, associated to the corresponding  remote access service. Then I added a remote transmission widget on my browser, and opened the ports on the router, et voilà, I was now able to add/remove/manage any legal torrent/magnet from any place, with the great commodity of arriving home with the contents already downloaded and available for use.</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Receipt Management Software</strong></li>
								</ul>
								Although the utility of all the previous configurations, the most interesting thing I made so far with the Raspberry Pi was to develop a simple C routine to run on the raspberry or any device accessing with an SSH session.<br>
								This consisted in a Receipt Management SW, where I could save, add, list or organize different receipts very easily, instead of using an ordinary receipt book. This program which would run by simply executing a bin file on the Raspberry Pi terminal, had the information saved in the USB Flash Drive so it could be easy to transport and hard get lost.<br>
								As of the program itself, it had the following interface:<br><br>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/rpi_4.png" data-lightbox="image-2">
										<img src="images/rpi_4.png" height="280"/>
									</a>
								</p>
								<p>Here, if you selected the 2nd option, for instance, you would have a list of the available plates, and then the details of the specified one:</p>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/rpi_5.png" data-lightbox="image-2">
										<img src="images/rpi_5.png" height="310"/>
									</a>
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>General Overview</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>At the end of these experiences a lot of advantages of this &#8220;cheap&#8221; computer seem obvious: it can perform most of  the same operations as an ordinary computer, while consuming much less resources, it&#8217;s very light and portable, provides very easy access to low-level components  it can be easily remotely accessed (with a smartphone inclusively).</p>

								</a>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The Motivation</strong></li>
								</ul>
									As a second attempt on the Micro-Mouse competition title, after achieving the 2nd place in the previous year (<a href="#MicroMouse" class="link">Micro-Mouse 2011</a>),
								me and <a title="Fábio Rico's Website" class="link" href="http://www.fabiorvrico.wordpress.com" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fábio Rico</a>, decided to participate again.<br>
									This time, however, a decision was made to build the entire robot from scratch, and then add some intelligence to it, which made the task harder, but also much more amusing and challenging.<br> 
									An early sketch can be found on the picture to the right.<br>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The Development</strong></li>
								</ul>
									We started out with the idea: "Let's create a tank-like robot!".<br> 
									We assembled some bicycle chains (to create robot caterpillar tracks), a thin base of metal for the structure, pieces of wood to fasten the sensors and create some wheels, acrylic for the Lighthouse receiver pole and then we bought all the electronics required and got down to work.<br>
								<a href="images/rato3.jpg" data-lightbox="image-3">
									<img src="images/rato3.jpg" height="250" style="float:left; margin: 2% 5% 1% 1%; border-radius:10px"/>
								</a>
									A servo was connected to the beacon receiver, allowing a 180 degrees movement, for an increased probability of capturing the signal.<br>
									Some of the electronics used:<br><br>
								<ul>
									<ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>

										<li>&#9658 2* DC Motors: 12V with 20RPM;</li>
										<li>&#9658 2* Servo Motors: TBD;</li>
									</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<br><br><br>Regarding the developed board, pictured above, it contains:<br><br>
								<a href="images/rato2.jpg" data-lightbox="image-3">
									<img src="images/rato2.jpg" height="250" style="float:right; margin: 0 1% 1% 5%; border-radius:10px"/>
								</a>	
								<ul>
									<ul>
										<li>&#9658 Hot-pluggable socket for the pic32 development board;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Signal conditioning for the all the DC motors, servos and sensors provided on-board;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Some on-board buttons and LEDs available for testing;</li>
										<li>&#9658 Hot-pluggable slot for an RF UART module provided, for remote control of the vehicle (non-competition add-on);</li>
										<li>&#9658 Output/input ports available for future usage as a generic tests board.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
									Regarding the SW, most of the previous year robot intelligence was re-utilized, however many aspects had to be optimized/modified or completely renovated due to the new hardware.<br>
									The final robot, dressed for the competition is pictured to the right, on its full splendour as a small tank-like vehicle!<br><br>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The Competition</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									After the robot was assembled the tests sessions began. One of these sessions can be seen in the video below, where the robot had to avoid the obstacles around it, whilst not having a destination reference.
								</p>
								<br>
								<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:centre; display: block;'>
									<iframe width='100%' height='500' src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/D5OZdfUp0_E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								</span>
								<br>
												
									Although in latter training sessions, and in the competition training grounds the robot had a great performance, there where some problems during the competition itself.<br>
								There was a problem with the ground sensors (used for beacon area detection): they were receiving the signals emitted from the contestant's obstacle detectors, and interpreting that as an indication of "arrival at destination". 
								That meant a faulty behaviour, immediately after the start of the competition, and consequent declassification from the match.
								During the second round of the competition, efforts were made to solve this problem, but with no success.<br>
								In the end the robot was declassified, but still, it was a great experience.<br><br>

								<li><strong>The "What?"</strong></li>
								</ul>
								This project is related with the work I made for my master thesis, and involves the concept of Energy Harvesting and the means to transform the received energy into a useful application.<br>
								This work was made in cooperation with the Telecommunications Institute of Aveiro, under the orientation of Professor Dr. Nuno Borges Carvalho, to whom I&#8217;m grateful for the support provided.<br>
								Basically the idea here was, through the understanding of the non-linear processes involved in the rectification process that converts the ambient RF power into DC energy, creating systems with high efficiency and/or output voltage. This ought to be achieved from the waves emitted by an ordinary FM emitter antenna, allowing the powering of 2/3 low consumption LED&#8217;s from a couple of hundred meters of distance to the source.<br>
								<ul>
								<br>
								<li><strong>The "How?"</strong></li>
								</ul>

								<p>Since the maximum harvested energy from the receiver antenna is always limited, and it's very hard to increase at about 100 MHz specially (only developing agglomerates or very large or  of antennas) a very delicate design of the circuit that effectively converts the RF energy from the waves into the DC is required. So it was the main point of this work to develop methods for increasing the efficiency of this process. A special focus was given to the matching of the conversion circuit, since a careful analysis revealed that the reflected power consisted in the major percentage of the power loss.</p>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/rf_2.png" data-lightbox="image-4">
										<img src="images/rf_2.png" style="border-radius:10px; margin:1%;" width="474" height="294" />
									</a>
								</p>
								<p>That said, without entering an extensive level of detail, one of the main tools developed was a software running on ADS 2012, that allowing a flexible and accurate matching of the circuit. This tool allowed to match the circuit considering either for a specific output voltage or for a higher power efficiency. A picture of this can be found above, where it&#8217;s seen the smith charts used for the matching on both purposes (power efficiency and output voltage) on the centre and a series of auxiliary equations on the side. Also the results for each of the matching circles (and in the limit the red point), show the current values for those positions.<br />
								Applying this theory a couple of circuits were developed, some to achieve higher efficiency using only one diode as main rectifier, and other employed more complex rectifiers/voltage multipliers such as the Dickson or the Villard to attain output voltages as high as possible. In parallel a simple FM antenna was built for proof of concept purposes. Some of the circuits developed can be found on the pictures below.</p>
 								<p style="text-align:centre;">
 									<a href="images/rf_3.jpg" data-lightbox="image-4">
										<img src="images/rf_3.jpg" style="border-radius:10px; margin:1%;" height="180"  />
									</a>
								</p>
								<ul>
								<br>
								<li><strong>The "Big Picture"</strong></li>
								</ul>
								Getting all the elements together, a system that effectively converted the energy of a FM radio emitter into visible light was achieved, having been tested on the field in Aveiro, Portugal.<br>
								Basically the experienced consisted in two phases:<br><br>
								<ul>
									<ul>
										<li><span style="line-height:13px;"><strong>a)</strong> The energy-harvesting circuits without LED&#8217;s were connected to the FM antenna on one side, and to a multimeter on the other to measure the harvested DC voltage.</span></li>
										<li><strong>b) </strong>The multimeter and the previous circuits were replaced with a different set of circuits with 1 or 2 LED&#8217;s, to verify if the harvested energy could generate light.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<p>Both these experiences are briefly presented on a short video, presented below, where an overview of the practical results of this work can be found</p>
								<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:centre; display: block;'>
									<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='593' height='364' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/xEHFZO_CSiU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe>
								</span>
								<br>
								<p>On the picture below , the best results achieved are again presented, where it can be seen that up to a distance of 400m from an emitter, 2 LEDs where successfully powered up, having been obtained about 5.34 V.</p>
								<p style="text-align:centre;">
									<a href="images/rf_4.png" data-lightbox="image-4">
										<img src="images/rf_4.png" style="border-radius:10px; margin:1%;" height="350px">								
									</a>
								</p>
								<p>Closer to the same antenna, with both LEDs also turned on, a voltage as high as 7.01 V was possible.</p>

								Micro-Mouse is an event where small robots compete against each other to solve maze as fastest and with the minimum collisions as possible.<br>
								Basically the robots have to follow a signal until they reach a destination, and then they have to return to their starting point, and all has to be made without any human interference.<br>
								Although this was a multidisciplinary contest evolving both Hardware and Software, it was chosen to borrow the hardware provided by the organization of the event and focus on the software to solve the maze, only.<br>

								This robot, that came equipped with two DC motors and respective H-bridges, three Sharp distance sensors, an IV receiver (to detect the signal emitted from the centre of the maze) and a pic18f for processing, had to combine the abilities of following walls, avoiding other robots and finding the centre of the maze, all on it's own.<br>
								The developed algorithm had to:<br><br>
								<ul>
									<li>&#9658 Follow Walls</li>
									<li>&#9658 Avoid Obstacles (Other robots, very near walls)</li>
									<li>&#9658 Follow Beacon (to reach the centre)</li>
									<li>&#9658 Avoid Beacon (after reaching the centre of the maze, the implemented solution to reach the starting point was to just get away from the centre for a specified amount of time and then stopping)</li>
								</ul>
								The developed code, which was compiled with CCS and then sent to a pic18f258 trough a TinyBootLoader application, followed a simple structure with functions for each of the operations it had to execute, and some interruptions to generate time-triggered events, and some reads from the ADC.<br><br>
								The robot itself, which is shown in the photo to the right, having made a very good contest on the first three rounds, applied to the finals where it managed the second place of the competition, what earned us a pic32 proprietary board from the University of Aveiro Electronics Department (picture below).<br><br>

								<b>The name:</b> Luis Filipe Dias.<br><br>	
								<b>The degree:</b> Master in Electronics and Telecommunications, by the <b>University of Aveiro</b>.<br><br>	
								<b>The current whereabouts:</b> DTV Research in Lisbon, working as an <b>Embedded Systems Engineer</b>.<br><br>			
								<b>The main</b> professional interests:<br><br>		
								<ul >
									<li><b>&#9658 Radio-Frequency Electronics:</b> Antennas and Energy Harvesting Systems, since my thesis consisted on the study and development of efficient Energy Harvesting Circuits for generation of <b>no-cost illumination</b> (you can find more information here).</li><br>	
									<li><b>&#9658 Hardware Engineering:</b> 1.5 years working as a <b>Hardware Engineer</b> (Nokia Siemens Networks/Coriant), with cutting edge-hardware for fiber optics, sharpened my interest on this area of technology. Here are some things I learned:</li>
										<ul>
							       		<li>&#9642 To integrate a multidisciplinary team, responsible for the firmware integration of long-haul optical equipments;</li>
                						<li>&#9642 To execute and analyze hardware validation tests (surge testing, EMC, temperature tests, worst-case power consumption and others);</li>
                						<li>&#9642 To handle testing, measurement and characterization equipments for optical and high-frequency electrical interfaces (Optical Traffic Analyzers/Generators, High-Frequency Oscilloscopes, Variable Optical Attenuators, etc.);</li>
                						<li>&#9642 To comprehend and apply distinct standards/protocols, both internal and internationally regulated (ANSI, ITU-T, IEEE, ETSI,...)</li>
      								</ul>
									<li><b>&#9658 Embedded Systems Engineering:</b> my latest challenge, is about bridging between the hardware and the low level drivers, and then up the stack into the higher levels of the application. It has been a challenging but really worthwhile learning experience. Some of the things I do:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>&#9642 C - a lot!</li>
											<li>&#9642 Develop & debug embedded software for different chip-sets, architectures and hardware sets;</li>
											<li>&#9642 Work at different levels of the SW stack (from the device-drivers to the application);</li>
											<li>&#9642 Comprehend and modify build-systems (cmake, kbuild, ...);</li>
											<li>&#9642 Debug problems on the HW layer;</li>
											<li>&#9642 Prepare setups for SW validation tests;</li>
											<li>&#9642 Understand and enforce technical specifications;</li>
										</ul>
								</ul>
								Other non-related personal interests involve travelling, gastronomy, cinema, mountain biking, squash or table tennis.<br>
